# ShellCheck configuration for roulette project
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive

# Disable style-only warnings
disable=SC2250  # Prefer braces around variables (style preference)

# Keep these as info (they're already suppressed appropriately in code)
# SC2310: function invoked in if condition (set -e disabled)
# SC2311: set -e disabled in command substitution
# SC2312: command in process substitution may mask return value

# Severity: only fail on warning or error, not info/style
# Use: shellcheck -S warning
